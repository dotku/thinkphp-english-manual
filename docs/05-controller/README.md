## Controller

Controller in ThinkPHP 5.0 is flexible. It could be used without any basic class or extend official \think\Controller class or other Controller class.

(to be continue ...)

> Any PHP reserved keywords won't be allowed to be used as controller name, and it is case insensitive, i.e., you can't create "Private" controller, since "private" is reserved.
